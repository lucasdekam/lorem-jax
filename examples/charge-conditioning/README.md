# Training example: charge conditioning

Trains `Lorem` on a small mixed-charge-state dataset, to check that
conditioning the model on the total charge `Q` of a structure actually helps
it tell charge states apart. `Lorem`/`LoremQ` condition on `Q` through `charge_conditioning`, which selects
between FiLM modulation of the node features (`backbone.py`'s
`ChargeConditioning`) and an explicit quadratic expansion of the energy in `Q`
(`QuadraticReadout`). A missing/zero `Q` is harmless either way — the FiLM layer
is a near-identity transform at `Q=0`, and the quadratic terms vanish.

## Data

`data.xyz` is a cropped slice (60 structures, stratified across the two
charge states) of the Ag₃⁺/Ag₃⁻ dataset from Ko, Finkler, Goedecker &
Behler, *Nat. Commun.* **12**, 398 (2021) — see
`~/projects/lorem-q/Ag_clusters/README.md` for the full dataset and
provenance. Every Ag₃ trimer here is small enough that the whole cluster
sits inside any reasonable cutoff, so a purely local model has no
structural excuse for failing to distinguish the two charge states — this
isolates the value of Q-conditioning itself, independent of any
long-range/beyond-cutoff effects. That's also why `lr: false` in
`model.yaml`: this dataset isn't the place to test the Ewald long-range
channel.

The original `tot_charge` field in `atoms.info` has been renamed to
`total_charge`, which is the key `lorem/batching.py` reads to populate the
model's `Q` input. `Lorem`/`LoremQ` default to `charge_conditioning="film"`
and treat a missing `total_charge` as Q=0.
